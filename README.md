## Intro

Founded in 2022, the Veovera Software Organization (VSO) is a dedicated not-for-profit entity committed to enhancing software technology for the public good. VSO has played a pivotal role in advancing the Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP), notably through collaboration with industry leaders such as Adobe, YouTube, Twitch and others. Our collective efforts focus on refining and broadening the capabilities of RTMP to ensure it meets the evolving demands of modern media streaming.

## Abstract

As the media streaming landscape continues to evolve, the VSO has emerged as a pivotal force in modernizing the RTMP/FLV protocol, a cornerstone of streaming technology that had remained largely unaltered for over two decades. Through our pioneering initiatives, we have introduced initial enhancements “[enhanced-rtmp-v1](https://veovera.github.io/enhanced-rtmp/docs/enhanced/enhanced-rtmp-v1)” (or "[enhanced-rtmp-v1.pdf](https://veovera.github.io/enhanced-rtmp/docs/enhanced/enhanced-rtmp-v1.pdf)”) and the latest alpha specification, "[enhanced-rtmp-v2](https://veovera.github.io/enhanced-rtmp/docs/enhanced/enhanced-rtmp-v2)" (or "[enhanced-rtmp-v2.pdf](https://veovera.github.io/enhanced-rtmp/docs/enhanced/enhanced-rtmp-v2.pdf)”). This key publication outlines substantial advancements to [legacy RTMP](https://veovera.org/docs/legacy/), including:

- **Advanced Audio Codecs:** Integration of codecs like AC-3, E-AC-3, Opus, and FLAC to meet diverse audio quality and compression needs, ensuring compatibility with modern systems.  
- **Multichannel Audio Configurations:** Support for multichannel audio to enhance auditory experiences without compromising existing setups.  
- **Advanced Video Codecs:** Introduction of codecs such as VP8, VP9, HEVC and AV1 with HDR support to meet modern display and content standards.  
- **Video Metadata:** Expansion of VideoPacketType.Metadata to support a broader range of video metadata types.  
- **FourCC Signaling:** Inclusion of FourCC signaling for advanced codecs mentioned above, as well as for legacy codecs such as AVC, AAC, and MP3.  
- **Multitrack Capabilities:** New audio and video multitrack capabilities for concurrent management and processing of multiple media streams, enhancing media experiences.  
- **Reconnect Request Feature:** A new Reconnect Request feature improves connection stability and resilience.  
- **Timestamp Precision:** Introduction of nanosecond precision offsets, ensuring enhanced synchronization and compatibility across diverse media formats such as MP4, M2TS, and Safari's Media Source Extensions, without altering the core RTMP timestamps.

These enhancements are designed to align RTMP with contemporary streaming technology standards, ensuring its relevance and efficacy in today's digital landscape.

Protocols and standards should be open and free, fostering innovation and creating a thriving ecosystem. Companies should capitalize on solutions built around open standards; the more popular and open a protocol is, the stronger the foundation for developing compelling solutions. A standard’s popularity fuels adoption, allowing companies to leverage its widespread use. Fragmentation caused by proprietary protocols hampers industry growth, while open standards enable everyone to contribute and innovate freely, creating a healthier marketplace. **E-RTMP’s** shift towards openness aligns with the principles of open standards, highlighting its potential to become a foundational technology.
