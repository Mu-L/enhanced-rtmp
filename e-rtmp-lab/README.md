# e-rtmp-lab

A lab workspace maintained by the Veovera Software Organization for prototyping E‑RTMP features and validating the specification. Within the lab, individual experiments are tracked, each with its own documentation and tooling to support rapid iteration. Each experiment lives under [wip/](wip/) (work in progress). Experiments that mature may be promoted to a permanent location. Experiments include their own documentation and tooling to support fast iteration.

## Repository layout

- [wip/e-flv-js/](wip/e-flv-js/) – Hybrid TypeScript/JavaScript implementation, with most core modules ported to TypeScript, for playing enhanced FLV (E‑FLV) and legacy FLV files in the browser via [Media Source Extensions (MSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Media_Source_Extensions_API). Includes a demo app and sample video assets. See its README for details.

Additional experiments will appear under [wip/](wip/) as needed. Each project documents its own description and build steps, keeping this top-level README focused and simple.
