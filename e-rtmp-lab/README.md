# e-rtmp-lab

A lab workspace maintained by the Veovera Software Organization for prototyping E‑RTMP features and validating the specification. Each experiment lives under [wip/](wip/) (work in progress). If a lab matures, it will be moved to a more permanent location. Experiments include their own documentation and tooling to support fast iteration.

## Repository layout

- [wip/e-flv-js/](wip/e-flv-js/) – TypeScript implementation for playing enhanced FLV (E‑FLV) and legacy FLV in the browser via [Media Source Extensions (MSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Media_Source_Extensions_API). Includes a demo app and sample video assets. See its README for details.

Additional experiments will appear under [wip/](wip/) as needed. Each project will document its own description and build steps, keeping this top-level README focused and simple.
