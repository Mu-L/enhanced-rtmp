## Documentation Versioning

### Overview

This section outlines our standardized approach for versioning our specification documentation. Effective versioning ensures consistency, enables users to identify the latest version easily, and facilitates collaboration among team members.

### File Naming Convention

We name the documentation files with a clear identifier and the major version number. \
&nbsp; \
Example: \
**enhanced-rtmp-v2.pdf**

### Version Information Inside the Document

We include a dedicated section or metadata within each document to specify the version details which includes the major version number, date, and stage of development (alpha/beta/release). \
&nbsp; \
Example: \
**Status: v2-2024-02-26-a1**

### Calendar Versioning Format Description

The format for versioning documents is structured as follows:

- **v#-yyy-mm-dd-[a\|b\|r]#:**
  - **v#:** Major version number for tracking the progression of the E-RTMP development.
  - **yyyy-mm-dd:** Date when the document was updated.
  - **[a\|b\|r]:** Suffix to distinguish between the alpha, beta, and release stage.
  - **\#:** Minor version number for a particular date. Increments for multiple versions on the same date.

This format provides a comprehensive overview of each version's status and chronological order, facilitating effective tracking and management of the E-RTMP specification development.

## Version Stage Definitions

We define distinct stages for the development of the E-RTMP protocol specification to indicate its maturity and readiness for implementation. Each stage serves a different purpose for those implementing the protocol:

### Alpha Version

- **Purpose**: The alpha stage represents an early, stable version of the protocol specification. It is intended for real-world implementation and feedback collection from developers and implementers who are beginning to build solutions based on the protocol.
- **Features**: While the specification is mostly defined, some aspects may still evolve based on implementation feedback. Breaking changes are possible, but efforts are made to minimize them to ensure stability for early adopters.
- **Audience**: Developers and implementers looking to integrate the protocol in real-world applications who are prepared to adapt to refinements or changes.
- **Stability**: Moderate. The alpha version is considered stable enough for serious implementation, but it is still subject to potential changes that could affect backward compatibility.
- **Documentation Status**: Indicated by the version identifier "a" (e.g., **v2-2024-02-26-a1**).

### Beta Version

- **Purpose**: The beta stage indicates that the protocol specification is nearing its final form, with all core features defined and ready for implementation across diverse environments. This stage focuses on verifying that the protocol works reliably at scale, with extensive real-world testing.
- **Features**: The protocol is comprehensively specified, and any changes at this stage should ideally be non-breaking. These changes may involve optimizations or clarifications to ensure smooth, large-scale deployments, but no core elements of the protocol are expected to be altered.
- **Audience**: Developers and organizations preparing for production use, who are looking to validate their implementations against a near-final version of the protocol.
- **Stability**: High. The beta version is stable enough for broad implementation with the expectation that no significant breaking changes will be introduced.
- **Documentation Status**: Indicated by the version identifier "b" (e.g., **v2-2024-02-26-b1**).

### Release Version (General Availability)

- **Purpose**: The release (General Availability) stage is the finalized version of the protocol specification, fully stable and ready for widespread production use.
- **Features**: The specification is locked, and no breaking changes should occur. Any updates will focus on backward-compatible improvements or bug fixes.
- **Audience**: Developers, implementers, and end-users who need a reliable, long-term stable version for production deployments.
- **Stability**: Highest. The release version ensures stability for production environments with long-term support.
- **Documentation Status**: Indicated by the version identifier "r" (e.g., **v2-2024-02-26-r1**).

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/bcp14) [[RFC2119](#rfc2119)] [[RFC8174](#rfc8174)] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here. Definitions below are reproduced from [[RFC2119](#rfc2119)].

- **MUST**: This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", means that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.
- **MUST NOT**: This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT", means that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.
- **SHOULD**: This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", means that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
- **SHOULD NOT**: This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED", means that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label.
- **MAY**: This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", means that an item is truly optional. One vendor may choose to include the item because a particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item. An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the same vein an implementation which does include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the option provides.)

Additionally we add the keyword [[DEPRECATED](#deprecated)] to the set of keywords above.

- **DEPRECATED**: This word means a discouragement of use of some terminology, feature, design, or practice, typically because it has been superseded or is no longer considered efficient or safe, without completely removing it or prohibiting its use. Typically, deprecated materials are not completely removed to ensure legacy compatibility or back-up practice in case new methods are not functional in an odd scenario. It can also imply that a feature, design, or practice will be removed or discontinued entirely in the future.

## Abstract

In the rapidly evolving media streaming landscape, there is a pressing need to update legacy protocols to align with modern technological standards. The Real-Time Messaging Protocol [[RTMP](#rtmp)] and Flash Video [[FLV](#flv)] file format, introduced in 2002, have been pivotal and continue to be vital especially in live broadcasting. Despite RTMP widespread use, it has shown signs of aging, particularly in the lack of support for contemporary video codecs (e.g., VP8, VP9, HEVC, AV1) and audio codecs (Opus, FLAC, AC-3, E-AC-3). Recognizing this, Veovera Software Organization (VSO), in collaboration with industry giants like Adobe, YouTube, and Twitch, and other key stakeholders, has embarked on a mission to rejuvenate RTMP, ensuring it meets the demands of contemporary streaming needs. \
&nbsp; \
This document details the comprehensive enhancements made to the RTMP and FLV specifications, aimed at revitalizing the technology for current and future media demands. Our strategic approach prioritizes innovation while maintaining backward compatibility, thereby augmenting RTMP's utility without undermining existing infrastructures. Some of the key advancements include:

- **Advanced Audio Codecs**: Integration of codecs like AC-3, E-AC-3, Opus, and FLAC to meet diverse audio quality and compression needs, ensuring compatibility with modern systems.
- **Multichannel Audio Configurations**: Support for multichannel audio to enhance auditory experiences without compromising existing setups.
- **Advanced Video Codecs**: Introduction of codecs such as VP8, VP9, HEVC and AV1 with HDR support to meet modern display and content standards.
- **Video Metadata**: Expansion of **VideoPacketType.Metadata** to support a broader range of video metadata types.
- **FourCC Signaling**: Inclusion of FourCC signaling for advanced codecs mentioned above, as well as for legacy codecs such as AVC, AAC, and MP3.
- **Multitrack Capabilities**: New audio and video multitrack capabilities for concurrent management and processing of multiple media streams, enhancing media experiences.
- **Reconnect Request Feature**: A new Reconnect Request feature improves connection stability and resilience.
- **Timestamp Precision:** Introduction of nanosecond precision offsets, ensuring enhanced synchronization and compatibility across diverse media formats such as MP4, M2TS, and Safari's Media Source Extensions, without altering the core RTMP timestamps.

The additional audio and video codecs supported by enhanced RTMP are summarized in the following table: \

These strategic enhancements position RTMP as a robust, future-proof standard in the streaming technology arena. Veovera is committed to open collaboration and values community input, believing that protocols and standards should be open and free to foster innovation and create a thriving ecosystem. Companies can capitalize on solutions built around open standards; the more popular and accessible a protocol is, the stronger the foundation for developing compelling solutions. A standardâs popularity fuels adoption, allowing companies to leverage its widespread use. In contrast, fragmentation caused by proprietary protocols hampers industry growth, while open standards empower everyone to innovate freely, creating a healthier marketplace. E-RTMPâs shift toward openness aligns with the principles of open standards, emphasizing its potential to become a foundational technology. We encourage participation in the ongoing development process through our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/veovera/enhanced-rtmp), where you can access detailed documentation, contribute to the project, and share insights to foster a vibrant ecosystem around enhanced E-RTMP.

## Introduction

This document describes enhancements to legacy [[RTMP](#rtmp)] and legacy [[FLV](#flv)], introducing support for new media codecs, HDR capability, and more. A primary objective is to ensure these enhancements do not introduce breaking changes for established clients or the content they stream. As such, legacy RTMP and legacy FLV specifications remain integral to the RTMP ecosystem. While this updated specification aims to minimize redundancy with previous versions, when combined with previous-generation documentation, it provides a comprehensive overview of the RTMP solution. We've drawn from several legacy references, which are as follows:

- Adobe legacy [[RTMP](#rtmp)] specification
- Adobe legacy [[FLV](#flv)] specification
- Additional [[LEGACY](#legacy)] specifications

## Conventions

This document employs certain conventions to convey particular meanings and requirements. The following section outlines the notation, terminology, and symbols used throughout to ensure clarity and consistency. These conventions provide insight into the ethos of how the E-RTMP specification has been crafted and should be interpreted.

- **Enhanced RTMP**: refers to a series of improvements made to the legacy Real-Time Messaging Protocol [[RTMP](#rtmp)], originally developed by Adobe. It's important to note that "enhanced RTMP" is not a brand name but a term used to distinguish this advanced version from the legacy RTMP specification. Endorsed by Adobe and widely adopted across the industry, enhanced RTMP serves as the current standard for RTMP solutions. This updated protocol includes various enhancements to both legacy RTMP and the legacy [[FLV](#flv)] formats. Please be aware that the term "enhanced RTMP" (a.k.a., E-RTMP) signifies ongoing updates to RTMP and FLV, and does not pertain to any specific iteration or release.
- **Pseudocode**: Pseudocode has been provided to convey logic on how to interpret the E-RTMP binary format. The code style imitates a cross between TypeScript and C. The pseudocode was written in TypeScript and validated using VSCode to ensure correct syntax and catch any minor typographical errors. Below are some further explanations:

  - Enumerations are used to define valid values
  - Pseudo variables are named in a self-descriptive manner. For instance: \
     \
    **`videoCommand = UI8 as VideoCommand`** \
     \
    The line above indicates that an unsigned 8-bit value is read from the bitstream. The legal values correspond to the enumerations within the **VideoCommand** set, and the pseudo variable **videoCommand** now holds that value.
  - The pseudocode is written from the point of view of reading (a.k.a., parsing) the bitstream. If you are writing the bitstream, you can swap source with destination variables.
  - E-RTMP typically employs camelCase naming conventions for variables. In contrast, the naming convention for legacy RTMP specification is usually preserved as is.
  - Handshake and [Enhancing NetConnection **connect** command](#enhancing-netconnection-connect-command): The E-RTMP specification generally prioritizes the client's perspective over that of the server. To shift this focus and view the interaction from the server's side, the server should echo back certain enhancement information. \
     \
    When the client informs the server of the enhancements it supports via the **connect** command, the server processes this command and responds using the same transaction ID. The server's response string will be one of the following: **\_result**, **\_error**, or a specific method name. A command string of **\_result** or **\_error** indicates a response rather than a new command. \
     \
    During this response, the server will include an object containing specific properties as one of the arguments to **\_result**. It is at this point that the server should indicate its support for E-RTMP features. Specifically, the server should denote its capabilities through attributes such as **videoFourCcInfoMap**, **capsEx**, and other defined properties.
  - The ethos of this pseudocode is to provide a high-level overview of the data structures and operations taking place on the wire. While it accurately represents the bytes being transmitted, it's important to note that the logic is not exhaustive. Specifically, this pseudocode does not cover all possible cases, nor does it always include items such as initialization logic, looping logic or error-handling mechanisms. It serves as a foundational guide that can be implemented in various ways, depending on specific needs and constraints.

- **Unrecognized value**: If a value in the bitstream is not understood, the logic must fail gracefully in a manner appropriate for the implementation.
- **Table naming**: Each table in the document is named according to the specific content or subject it is describing.
- **Bitstream optimization**: One of the guiding principles of E-RTMP is to optimize the number of bytes transmitted over the wire. While minimizing payload overhead is a priority, it is sometimes more important to simplify the logic or enhance extensibility. For example, although more optimal methods for creating a codec ID than using FOURCC may exist, such approaches could render the enhancement non-standard and more challenging to extend and maintain in the future.
- **Capitalization rules**: Another guiding principle in the E-RTMP is the standardization of capitalization for types. The original documentation capitalized types such as Number, String, and Boolean, and even included various other spellings. The E-RTMP adopts lowercase spelling for terms, such as number, string, and boolean. This change emphasizes that these types are simple, not objects.
- **ECMA Array vs Object**: In the world of AMF (Action Message Format), both ECMA Array and Object are used to store collections of properties. A property is simply a pairing of a name with a value. In enhanced RTMP, the term Object is specifically used to indicate the Object Type. In the past, people have sometimes used ECMA Array and Object as if they were the same thing. However, for better coding practices, it's recommended to use Object when you're creating AMF data. When you're reading or decoding AMF data, you should be prepared to handle either ECMA Array or Object for greater flexibility and robustness.
- **Default values**: Unless explicitly called out, there should be no assumptions made regarding default values, such as null or undefined.
- **Legacy vs. Enhanced Properties**: In the documentation, an effort has been made to distinguish between legacy properties and newly defined ones through color coding, such as using bold text or different background colors for enhancements. While this color coding is not guaranteed to be consistent, the distinctions between values defined in E-RTMP should be readily apparent.
- **Capability flags**: The capabilities flags, exchanged during a connect handshake, may not cover all possible functionalities. For instance, a client might indicate support for multitrack processing without specifying its ability to encode or decode multitrack streams. In scenarios where a client, capable of issuing a play command, declares multitrack support, it MUST be equipped to handle the playback of such streams. Similarly, if a client is aware of the server's multitrack capabilities, it MAY opt to publish a multitrack stream.
- **Quotation Marks and Emphasis Guidelines**: Ultimately, the context should drive the meaning, but we make an effort to leverage quotation marks and emphasis (i.e., **bold**) to maintain readability. We aim to avoid syntactic sugar as much as possible to ensure the document remains straightforward, easy to read, scan, and understand. The conventions for using double quotes ("), back quotes (`), and emphasis in this document to ensure clarity and consistency are as follows:

  - **Double quotes are used for:** direct quotations, titles of short works, and when referencing a specific term or phrase.
  - **Back quotes are used for:** code snippets, commands, or technical terms.
  - **Bold is used for:** emphasis on important terms or phrases. Sometimes, back quotes and bold can be interchanged for ease of reading.

## Simple Data Types

## RTMP Message Format

Adobe's Real-Time Messaging Protocol [[RTMP](#rtmp)] is an application-level protocol designed for the multiplexing and packetizing of multimedia streamsâsuch as audio, video, and interactive content, for transmission over network protocols like TCP. A fundamental feature of RTMP is the Chunk Stream, which facilitates the multiplexing, packetizing, and prioritization of messages, integral to the protocol's real-time capabilities. \
&nbsp; \
The legacy RTMP specification in [Section 6.1](https://veovera.github.io/enhanced-rtmp/docs/legacy/rtmp-v1-0-spec.pdf#page=22) elaborates on the RTMP Message Format, providing precise encoding guidelines for the RTMP message header, inclusive of field widths and byte order. However, this portrayal might be somewhat confusing because RTMP messages, when transported over the Chunk Stream, don't literally conform to this depicted format. An RTMP Message is divided into two principal components: a message virtual header and a message payload. The "virtual" descriptor indicates that while RTMP messages are carried within the RTMP Chunk Stream, their headers are conceptually encoded as Chunk Message Headers. When these are decoded from the RTMP Chunk Stream, the underlying transport layer, the resulting format is to be understood as a virtual header. This abstract representation aligns with the structured format and semantics detailed in the legacy RTMP specification. Detailed next is the format of the message virtual header and some additional related information.

- There are two message types reserved for media messages:
  - The message type value of 8 is reserved for audio message
  - The message type value of 9 is reserved for video messages
- The message payload follows the header and may contain various types of content, such as compressed audio or video data. RTMP itself does not recognize or process the payload's content. If new codec types are to be added, they must be defined where the actual payload internals are outlined. FLV is a container file format where the specifics of the AV payload, including the codecs, are defined.
- Please refer to the legacy RTMP specification (in various locations) and the legacy [[FLV](#flv)] specification (Annex E) for details on the endianness (a.k.a., byte order) of the data format on the wire.

## FLV File Format Overview

An [[FLV](#flv)] file is a container for AV (Audio and Video) data. The file consists of alternating back-pointers and tags, each accompanied by data related to that tag. Each **TagType** within an FLV file is unsigned and defined by 5 bits. **AUDIODATA** has a **TagType** of 8, and **VIDEODATA** has a **TagType** of 9.

>**Note:** Each **TagType** corresponds directly to the same **MessageType ID**, defined by UI8, in the [[RTMP](#rtmp)] specification. This alignment is intentional.

**TagType** values of 8 or 9 are accompanied by an **AudioTagHeader** or **VideoTagHeader** respectively. While RTMP is commonly associated with FLV, it is important to note that RTMP is a protocol, whereas FLV is a file container format. This distinction is why they were originally defined in separate specifications. This enhancement specification aims to improve both RTMP and FLV.

## Enhancements to RTMP and FLV

Within the following sections, this document provides a comprehensive overview of the enhancements made to [[RTMP](#rtmp)] and [[FLV](#flv)]. Together, these improvements constitute the enhanced RTMP also known as E-RTMP. These enhancements are discussed in detail, highlighting their impact and benefits.

## Enhancing onMetaData

[[FLV](#flv)] metadata SHALL be encapsulated within a [[SCRIPTDATA](#scriptdata)] segment, which includes a [[ScriptTagBody](#scripttagbody)] encoded in the Action Message Format (AMF). Importantly, this metadata SHALL always remain unencrypted, even when the FLV content itself is encrypted. This design choice is essential for allowing various FLV parsers to successfully stream the FLV content and for enabling media players to provide contextual information to the user. \
&nbsp; \
The **ScriptTagBody** is structured to encapsulate method invocations. It consists of an item containing a method name (e.g., **onMetaData**) along with a corresponding set of arguments. \
&nbsp; \
To signal FLV metadata, the item within the **ScriptTagBody** MUST encapsulate the method name **onMetaData**, along with a single argument of type ECMA array. This array holds metadata properties, the availability of which may vary depending on the software used to create the FLV. Typical **onMetaData** argument properties include, but are not limited to: \

## Reconnect Request

### Objective

[[RTMP](#rtmp)] packetizes multimedia streams using a suitable transport protocol, typically a persistent TCP connection. There are instances when a streaming platform may request the streaming client to reconnect, such as:

- When live streaming servers undergo updates.
- When there's a need to redirect the client to a different server instance, ensuring optimal load balancing and precise geolocation mapping.

To accommodate these needs, a **NetConnection.Connect.ReconnectRequest** status event has been introduced as part of the **NetConnection onStatus** command.

### NetConnection Commands

**NetConnection** establishes a bidirectional link between a client and a server, allowing for asynchronous Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs). The following commands (a.k.a., predefined RPCs) can be issued via **NetConnection**:

- **connect**
- **createStream**
- **deleteStream**
- **onStatus**

The **onStatus** command has been enhanced to include the capability to request a client to reconnect. Servers can issue an **onStatus** command to prompt clients to adapt to changes in **NetConnection** status. The structure of this command, as relayed from the server to the client, is outlined below: \

### Message Flow When Handling NetConnection.Connect.ReconnectRequest

1. Prior to the shutdown of the live streaming server or when the server intends to remap the client to another server instance, it dispatches an **onStatus** command to the client with a **code** of **NetConnection.Connect.ReconnectRequest**. If the server aims to remap the client, it MUST set the **tcUrl** property in the Info Object. In order to avoid a disruption, the server managing the original connection (commonly referred to as the "old server") SHOULD continue processing messages from the client until the client disconnects.
1. When the client receives the **NetConnection.Connect.ReconnectRequest** event, it persists in streaming to/from the current server up to the next appropriate media boundary, such as a keyframe. Subsequently, it establishes a connection with a new server and disconnects from the old server. If the Info Object includes the **tcUrl** property, the client uses this URL for the reconnection process. Absent this property, the client defaults to the **tcUrl** for the current connection.
1. While the client can establish a new connection before severing the original one, it SHOULD exercise caution to ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) is not compromised.

The capability to support the **NetConnection.Connect.ReconnectRequest** event becomes evident during the initial connect phase. Detailed guidelines for signaling reconnect ability can be found in the [Enhancing NetConnection **connect** Command](#enhancing-netconnection-connect-command) section.

### Detailed Overview of the onStatus Command for NetConnection

The server-to-client **onStatus** command for **NetConnection**, serves a crucial function within the RTMP framework. Though the legacy RTMP specification may not have detailed this command, the goal here is to offer an overview for a better understanding. \
&nbsp; \
Both clients and servers can initiate RPCs at the receiving end, with some RPCs being predefined as commands. **onStatus** stands out as one such essential command. \
&nbsp; \
When using the **onStatus** command, the goal is to inform the client about the status of the connection. Each dispatched command message comprises the following elements:

- **Command Name**: type string
- **Transaction ID**: type number
- **Command Object** (set to null when dispatching an onStatus command): type Object
- **Info Object** (which can be viewed as Optional Arguments): type Object

Both the Command Object and the Info Object offer additional context and details for the command. The **onStatus** command is triggered whenever there's a status change or an error concerning the **NetConnection**. To handle this information, you should define a callback function.

```js
// Sample pseudocode for the onStatus callback function
nc.onStatus = function(infoObject) {
  // Handle the status change or error here.
}
```

**infoObject** is an AMF-encoded object with properties that provide information about the status of a **NetConnection**. It contains at least the following three properties, but MAY contain other properties as appropriate to the client. \
&nbsp; \
**Table**: **infoObject** for **onStatus** command

## Enhanced Audio

The **AudioTagHeader** has been extended to define additional audio codecs, multichannel audio, multitrack capabilities, signaling support, and additional miscellaneous enhancements, while ensuring backward compatibility. This extension is termed the **ExAudioTagHeader** and is designed to be future-proof, allowing for the definition of additional audio codecs, features, and corresponding signaling. \
&nbsp; \
During the parsing process, the logic MUST handle unexpected or unknown elements gracefully. Specifically, if any critical signaling or flags (e.g., AudioPacketType and AudioFourCc) are not recognized, the system MUST fail in a controlled and predictable manner.

>**Important:** A single audio message for a unique timestamp may include a batch of AudioPacketType values (e.g., multiple **TrackId** values). When parsing an audio message, the bitstream MUST be processed completely to ensure all payload data has been handled.

## Enhanced Video

The **VideoTagHeader** has been extended to define additional video codecs, multitrack capabilities, signaling support, and additional miscellaneous enhancements, while ensuring backward compatibility. This extension is termed the **ExVideoTagHeader** and is designed to be future-proof, allowing for the definition of additional video codecs, features, and corresponding signaling. \
&nbsp; \
During the parsing process, the logic MUST handle unexpected or unknown elements gracefully. Specifically, if any critical signaling or flags (e.g., **VideoFrameType**, **VideoPacketType**, or **VideoFourCc**) are not recognized, the system MUST fail in a controlled and predictable manner.

>**Important:** A single video message for a unique timestamp may include a batch of **VideoPacketType** values (e.g., multiple **TrackId** values, **Metadata** values). When parsing a video message, the bitstream MUST be processed completely to ensure all payload data has been handled.

## Metadata Frame

To support various types of video metadata, the legacy [[FLV](#flv)] specification has been enhanced. The VideoTagHeader has been extended to define a new **VideoPacketType.Metadata** (see ExVideoTagHeader table in [Enhanced Video](#enhanced-video) section) whose payload will contain an AMF-encoded metadata. The metadata will be represented by a series of [name, value] pairs. For now the only defined [name, value] pair is **["colorInfo", Object]**. When leveraging **VideoPacketType.Metadata** to deliver HDR metadata, the metadata MUST be sent prior to the video sequence, scene, frame or such that it affects. Each time a new **colorInfo** object is received it invalidates and replaces the current one. To reset to the original color state you can send **colorInfo** with a value of Undefined (the RECOMMENDED approach) or an empty object (i.e., **{}**). \
&nbsp; \
It is intentional to leverage a video message to deliver **VideoPacketType.Metadata** instead of other [[RTMP](#rtmp)] Message types. One benefit of leveraging a video message is to avoid any racing conditions between video messages and other RTMP message types. Given this, once your **colorInfo** object is parsed, the read values MUST be processed in time to affect the first frame of the video section which follows the **colorInfo** object. \
&nbsp; \
The **colorInfo** object provides HDR metadata to enable a higher quality image source conforming to BT.2020 (a.k.a., Rec. 2020) standard. The properties of the **colorInfo** object, which are encoded in an AMF message format, are defined below.

>**Note:**
>
>- For content creators: Whenever it behooves to add video hint information via metadata (e.g., HDR) to the FLV container it is RECOMMENDED to add it via **VideoPacketType.Metadata**. This may be done in addition (or instead) to encoding the metadata directly into the codec bitstream.
>- The object encoding format (i.e., AMF0 or AMF3) is signaled during the [**connect**](https://veovera.github.io/enhanced-rtmp/original-rtmp-related-specs/rtmp-v1-0-spec.pdf#page=29) command.

## Multitrack Streaming via Enhanced RTMP

### Introduction to Multitrack Capabilities

E-RTMP has introduced support for multitrack streaming, offering increased flexibility in audio and video streaming through the use of a track index (a.k.a., **trackId**). This feature allows for the serialization of multiple tracks over a single [[RTMP](#rtmp)] connection and stream channel. \
&nbsp; \
It's important to note that multitrack support is designed to augment, not replace, the option of using multiple streams for streaming. While both multiple streams and multitrack can potentially address the same use cases, the choice between them will depend on the specific capabilities of your RTMP implementation and requirements. In certain cases, multitrack may not be the most efficient option.

### Multitrack Sample Use Cases

- **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming**: Multitrack support allows the client to send Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) ladders, thus avoiding the need for server-side transcoding and reducing quality loss. This also facilitates sending content with multiple codecs like AV1, HEVC, and VP9.
- **Device Specific Streaming**: The feature allows for the streaming of different aspect ratios, tailored for various device profiles, enabling more dynamic and flexible presentations.
- **Frame-Level Synchronization**: For example, you can synchronize multiple camera views in a concert.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Support for multiple audio tracks in a single [[FLV](#flv)] file is now available, eliminating the need for multiple file versions.

### Multitrack Media Message Guidelines

- **Video Messages**: Each video message MUST include a **trackId** (refer to the **videoPacketType.Multitrack** entry in the **ExVideoTagHeader** table within the [Enhanced Video](#enhanced-video) section for video bitstream signaling) as it is not persistent across messages.
- **Audio Messages**: Similarly, each audio message MUST include a **trackId** (refer to the **AudioPacketType.Multitrack** in the **ExAudioTagHeader** table within the [Enhanced Audio](#enhanced-audio) section for audio bitstream signaling).
- **Payload Parsing**: All tracks within a single timestamp MUST be processed to ensure comprehensive media handling.
- **Track Ordering**: For identifying the highest priority (a.k.a., default track) or highest quality track, it is RECOMMENDED to use **trackId** set to zero. For tracks of lesser priority or quality, use multiple instances of **trackId** with ascending numerical values. The concept of **priority** or **quality** can have multiple interpretations, including but not limited to bitrate, resolution, default angle, and language. This recommendation serves as a guideline intended to standardize track numbering across various applications.

### SCRIPTDATA Multitrack Parameter Handling

- **trackId SHOULD be a Parameter**: For methods within RTMP that involve [[SCRIPTDATA](#scriptdata)] messages, the **trackId** can be a critical parameter for operations that pertain to specific media tracks. In such cases, the **trackId** SHOULD be passed in as an argument to the method, ensuring that the action or data manipulation is accurately applied to the correct track.
- **Recommended Parameter Passing**:
  - **Using a Map or Object Argument:** The recommended way to pass the **trackId** to methods involving SCRIPTDATA is by including it within a map or as a property of an object argument. This approach aligns with practices such as those used in the [Enhancing onMetaData](#enhancing-onmetadata) section, enhancing consistency and scalability across various implementations.
  - **Function Signature Example**: This method takes an object arg which contains the property **trackId**. This structure is particularly effective for managing multiple parameters efficiently and enhances the readability and maintainability of the code.

```js
function ScriptMethodName(arg: Object) {
  console.log("Invoking a script with trackId: ", arg.trackId);
}
```

- **Advantages of Parameter Passing Approach**:
  - **Clarity and Structure:** Using an object or map to pass arguments, including the trackId, organizes the parameters neatly and reduces the chances of errors or misalignment in parameter order.
  - **Enhanced Maintenance:** It becomes easier to add more parameters in the future without altering the method signature drastically, thereby maintaining compatibility and easing future enhancements. The style of passing the **trackId** as part of a structured object or map ensures a robust framework for handling SCRIPTDATA operations in RTMP streams, providing clear, scalable, and error-free management of track-specific data.

### Leveraging Multitrack Features in E-RTMP

Multitrack capabilities in E-RTMP offer a wide range of possibilities, from adaptive bitrate streaming to multi-language support. While this document doesn't prescribe specific encoding rules or manifest metadata, it aims to guide you through the complexities of leveraging multitrack features. Consider various parameters like codecs, frame rates, key frames, sampling rates, and resolutions to meet your unique objectives. Remember, media encoding settings are separate from E-RTMP configurations.

## Enhancing NetConnection connect Command

When a client connects to an E-RTMP server, it sends a [**connect**](https://veovera.github.io/enhanced-rtmp/docs/legacy/rtmp-v1-0-spec.pdf#page=29) command to the server. The command structure sent from the client to the server contains a Command Object, comprising name-value pairs. This is where the client indicates the audio and video codecs it supports. To declare support for newly defined codecs or other enhancements supported by the client, this name-value pair list must be extended. Below is the description of a new name-value pair used in the Command Object of the **connect** command. \

**Table:** New name-value pair that can be set in the Command Object

As you can see, the client declares to the server what enhancements it supports. The server responds with a command, either **\_result** or **\_error**, to indicate whether the response is a result or an error. During the response, the server provides some properties within an Object as one of the parameters. This is where the server needs to state its support for E-RTMP. The server SHOULD state its support via attributes such as **videoFourCcInfoMap**, **capsEx**, and similar properties.

## Action Message Format (AMF): AMF0 and AMF3

Action Message Format (AMF) is a compact binary format used to serialize [**SCRIPTDATA**](https://veovera.github.io/enhanced-rtmp/docs/legacy/video-file-format-v10-1-spec.pdf#page=80). It has two specifications: [[AMF0](#amf0)] and [[AMF3](#amf3)]. AMF3 improves on AMF0 by optimizing the payload size on the wire. To understand the full scope of these optimizations, please refer to the AMF0 and AMF3 specifications. \
&nbsp; \
Supporting AMF3 in the [[RTMP](#rtmp)] and [[FLV](#flv)] is beneficial due to its optimization over AMF0. Understanding the ecosystem is crucial before adding AMF3 support to RTMP or FLV.

### Enabling AMF3 in RTMP

To enable support for AMF3 in RTMP, the following steps are REQUIRED:

- Adding support for [Data Message](https://veovera.github.io/enhanced-rtmp/docs/legacy/rtmp-v1-0-spec.pdf#page=24), [Shared Object Message](https://veovera.github.io/enhanced-rtmp/docs/legacy/rtmp-v1-0-spec.pdf#page=24) and [Command Message](https://veovera.github.io/enhanced-rtmp/docs/legacy/rtmp-v1-0-spec.pdf#page=24) and their associated AMF3 message types (i.e., [15](https://veovera.github.io/enhanced-rtmp/docs/legacy/rtmp-v1-0-spec.pdf#page=24), [16](https://veovera.github.io/enhanced-rtmp/docs/legacy/rtmp-v1-0-spec.pdf#page=24) and [17](https://veovera.github.io/enhanced-rtmp/docs/legacy/rtmp-v1-0-spec.pdf#page=24)).
- Adding support for the AMF3 set of possible type markers ([see AMF3 specification section 3.1](https://veovera.github.io/enhanced-rtmp/docs/legacy/amf3-file-format-spec.pdf#page=5)).
- Signaling in the [**connect**](https://veovera.github.io/enhanced-rtmp/docs/legacy/rtmp-v1-0-spec.pdf#page=29) command that the AMF3 encoding format is supported in addition to AMF0.

RTMP has had AMF3 as part of its specification for some time now. During the handshake, the client declares whether it has support for AMF3.

### Enabling AMF3 in FLV

Prior to Y2023, the FLV file format did not have AMF3 as part of its **SCRIPTDATA** specification. To ensure support for AMF3 in FLV:

- Add a new FLV **TagType** 15 (i.e., in addition to **TagType** 18), which supports **SCRIPTDATA** encoded via AMF3 (i.e., similar to the way Data Message is handled).

### Important AMF3-encoded Historical Specification Clarification

Established, pre E-RTMP, specifications state the following:

- Command Messages carry the AMF-encoded commands between the client and the server. Message type values:
  - 20 for AMF0 encoding.
  - 17 for AMF3 encoding.
- Data Messages are sent by the client or server to send Metadata or user data to the peer, including details such as creation time, duration, theme, etc. Message type values:
  - 18 for AMF0 encoding.
  - 15 for AMF3 encoding.
- The message types 19 for AMF0 and 16 for AMF3 are reserved for Shared Object events.
- AMF0 was extended to allow an AMF0 encoding context to be switched to AMF3. A new type marker, [**avmplus-object-marker**](https://veovera.github.io/enhanced-rtmp/docs/legacy/amf0-file-format-spec.pdf#page=8) **(byte 0x11)**, was added. The presence of this marker signifies that the following value is encoded in AMF3. Legacy AMF0 systems that haven't been updated to support AMF3 should throw an unknown type error.

Unfortunately, the above is incomplete and may be somewhat unclear. To clarify, in addition to the above:

- Object Encoding property in the Command Object of the **connect** command indicates the type of serialization (a.k.a., encoding) supported by the client or server:
  - A value of 0 (default and optional) indicates support for AMF0 encoding and message types of 18, 19 and 20.
  - A value of 3 indicates support for both AMF0 and AMF3 encoding and message types of (18, 15), (19, 16) and (20, 17).
- Message payload for message types of 15, 16 and 17 starts with a format selector byte. Currently, only format 0 is defined to indicate AMF0-encoded values. It's possible to signal a switch to AMF3 serialization by prefixing an AMF3 value with an AMF0 **avmplus-object-marker (byte 0x11)**. The switch isn't sticky, and parsing MUST return to AMF0 encoding mode once the AMF3 value is serialized. This means that every AMF3 encoded value MUST be prefixed with an **avmplus-object-marker (byte 0x11)** as defined in AMF0.

## Protocol Versioning

There is no need for a version bump within E-RTMP for either the [[RTMP](#rtmp)] handshake sequence or the FLV header file version field. All of the enhancements are triggered via the newly defined additions to the bitstream format which donât break legacy implementations. E-RTMP is self describing in its capabilities.

## Document Revision History and Guidelines

The revision history section of this document is maintained to provide a clear and concise record of significant changes throughout its development phases, such as alpha, beta, and release. Here are the key points regarding how we manage this history:

- **Phase-Based Documentation:** Important changes made during each phase (alpha, beta, release) are documented in the revision history to keep readers informed of significant developments.
- **Transition Between Phases:** When transitioning from one phase to another (e.g., from alpha to beta), we clear the document revision history. This practice helps keep the document uncluttered and focused on the relevant phase.
- **Exclusion of Minor Changes:** Minor changes that are purely for wording clarification and do not involve adding new features or fixing bugs may be excluded from the revision history. Developers should prioritize ignoring formatting diffs when reviewing changes, as these do not affect logic or introduce new features. Focusing on substantive updates ensures efficient review and clear understanding of impactful modifications.
- **Commit History in GitHub:** The document and its revision history are maintained in GitHub repository at <[https://github.com/veovera/enhanced-rtmp](https://github.com/veovera/enhanced-rtmp)>. Although the document revision history is cleared periodically, all commits and their messages are preserved in GitHub, ensuring a comprehensive record of all changes made.
- **Version Changes:** When the version of the specification changes significantly (e.g., from v1 to v2), we again clear the revision history. Despite this, the full history of commits and their messages remains accessible in GitHub.

These guidelines ensure that the revision history in the specification document remains focused, relevant, and easy to navigate, while the complete history of all changes is securely stored and accessible in GitHub. \
